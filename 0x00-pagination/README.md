# Pagination Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pagination Project! This project focuses on implementing pagination functionality for a dataset of popular baby names. Pagination is an essential technique for handling large datasets efficiently, allowing users to navigate through data in manageable chunks.

In this project, you'll learn how to paginate datasets using different techniques, including simple page-based pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-resilient hypermedia pagination.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pagination-project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of pagination. Here's an overview of the tasks:

    Task 0: Simple Helper Function
        Implement a function to calculate index ranges for pagination.

    Task 1: Simple Pagination
        Implement pagination using page numbers and page size.

    Task 2: Hypermedia Pagination
        Extend pagination functionality with hypermedia metadata.

    Task 3: Deletion-Resilient Hypermedia Pagination
        Implement pagination that remains resilient to data deletions.

## Usage

Each task includes a main file that demonstrates the usage of the implemented functionality. You can run the main files to see the pagination in action.

Here's how to run the main files for each task:

```bash

python task_<task_number>/main.py
```
